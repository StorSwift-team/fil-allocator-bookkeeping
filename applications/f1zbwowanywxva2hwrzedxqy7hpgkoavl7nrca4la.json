    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a Chinese national scientific research facility operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is a special reflecting Schmidt telescope with 4000 fibers in a field of view of 20 deg2 in the sky. Until July 2019, LAMOST has completed its pilot survey, which was launched in October 2011 and ended in June 2012, and the regular survey of the first seven years, which was initiated on September 2012[1-7]. In this data release, there are totally 10,431,197 low resolution spectra published, which satisfy the selection criteria that the LAMOST LRS General Catalog also used. The data products of this release can be available from the website http://dr10.lamost.org/v2.0/.\n\nGuoshoujing Telescope (the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope LAMOST) is a National Major Scientific Project built by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Funding for the project has been provided by the National Development and Reform Commission. LAMOST is operated and managed by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",
