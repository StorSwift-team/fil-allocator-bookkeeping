# fil-allocator-bookkeeping

**Pathway description**
Storswift is focused on Manual pathway, particarlly for Public open data. We combine manual due diligence and automized tooling to make the allocation process as objective as possible. We follow all rules from governance team, hence the standard is getting tighter as the program evolves. Welcome to apply dataCap from our pathway.

**Allocation policy**
We follow the official standard distribution policy strictly and abide by the due deligence policy as described in the allocator application form.

**Risk mitigation approach**
For new clients, a small amount of dataCap will be granted to them for the first application. The trust is earned over time if they follow the rules and then larger amount of dataCap will be granted to them. If new clients made honest mistakes, he still got one chance to justify himself. But the dataCap distributing plan maybe extended as well.
For data ownership, if the client cannot prove the ownership of the dataset, then sign a waiver.
For data sealing metrics, we will do regular check-ins, we will run commands to view CID report and retrieval bot report to audit the dataCap distribution statistics at regular basis. We will pay special attention to Date of Running Out of DataCap(Expected)in the form, to detect any abnormalities and warn clients to start sealing ASAP.

**Dispute resolution process**
We StorSwift developed a voting tool called Power voting. Voting is the most transparent way to solve disputes. Anyone who has any type of disputes or disagreement among community members can submit a proposal including issue description, proof, link and solutions to vote. The Fil+ governance team will review the poll first and then set up a deadline to vote. The poll ends and issue is fixed as well. It’s a perfect way to solve disputes no matter in response time or transparency. 

**Audit plan**
As a V4 and V5 allocator, we deeply engaged in Fil+ program and always pay attention to new rules and guidelines from official governance meetings. So we plan to combine manual due diligence and automized tooling to make the allocation process as objective as possible. The rules will get tighter to reduce fraud and cheating. 
1.For client identity. The age of GitHub and official website domain that are used for submitting application should be at least 3 months old. Any doubts about the identity occurs, a third party KYC or business license is needed to prove the authenticity.
2.Client number.  To increase client diversity and avoid cheating, at least 3 clients involved.
3.Single client can not take 30% of the total requested dataCap.
4.Dataset sample.  Sample size should not be less than 0.1% of total requested amount. 
5.SP numbers and location. 5 SPs and 2 locations at least. The actual SPs should be strictly aligned with the SP list in application.
6.Spark retrieval rate. Overall retrieval score is above the average, and single SP retrieval success rate should be greater than 75%.
7.Storage provider should not be store duplicate data for more than 10%.
What’s more, we will adjust and improve the Client& SP performance according to governance watchdog’s advice, currently we will focus on reduce padding, ensure index files are updated timely, and push the SPs to increase RSR ASAP. Based on the successful experience as am existing allocator, we are confident that we will do much better in the future.
